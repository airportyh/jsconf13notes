* ignores the principle of fib sequence. But he realizes 

## Excercise 2: `factorial(n)`

## Jack Kerouac

lots of code interspersed with comments. and will only work with n = 43.

## James Joyce

"writing in ja is the imost ingenious...",  hacktorial. wants you to pass small arguments. returns answer in shillings and uses a function constructor, god knows why.

## Richard Feyman

" I newer pay attention to anything by experts, I program everything myself."

    function fractorial(n){
        with(math){
          var r = sqrt(PI)*pow(n/E, n);
          r *= pow(8*pow(n,3)+4*(n*n)+n+(1/30), 1/6);
          return r;
        }
    }

can handle non-integrors


## Arther Canon Doyle

factorials doesn't interstt him. He'll do the unfactorial. "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards". Looks into the case history. Illiminates the impossible. All factorials over 4 is divisible by 

## Samuel Johnson

"when one is tired of JAVA-SCRIPT, one is tired of LIFE"

he hung around in coffee shops a lot. really didn't like elaborate language. He liked very clean language: CoffeeScript. A bit sarcastic.  Defined recursion in the comments when he calls the

Paradies a lot the conventions of the times, uses `===`, hasOwnProperty, etc sacastically

      return n < 2 ? 1: factorial(n-1)*n;
    }
