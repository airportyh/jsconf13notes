=================

* was writing a game
* connection logic for game is hard, you can get the same player connecting to itself, for example
* SPA (single page app) solved it. Somehow.
* another thing that is hard, Add SSL, asks you for permission. On mobile phone you don't always get that popup. Also, your phone could be off and it will still send the data
* graphics, 3D scene. three.js from @seb_ly. 7fps on mobile, horrible. Fix: CSS3 Renderer performed better, but caused bugs: entired chunks to vanish, but weekend later bug was fixed.
* back to canvas, fixed perf problem by rendering background separately from forground. And used only one video canvas. Back to 30fps+ on mobile. 
* collision detection
* hard thing was getting video stream to project into the 3d scene

## Biggies

* newness of webrtc ate way more time than I anticipated
* google engineers are there to help
* maybe the hores came before the cart? (was too tech focused)

* ready for primetime? no
* being worked on a lot, but Microselft?
* mobile looking hopeful
* Give it 12 months
