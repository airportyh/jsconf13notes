APIs and Making the World better - Carter Rabasa
================================================

* I am a dad and I have 2 kids
* I am interested in teaching them programming
* Software is eating the world
* Examples of disruptive companies: Google, Amazon, Netflix, Pixar 
* Tesla - they are not software company? But if you talk to elong musk, they hire software people, and they use write/use a lot of software
* Twilio is trying to disrupt the telecom industry. Think about the worst phone you've ever used: those are made by hardware people. Twilio is trying to enable software people to deliver those experiences
* remotes, look at TV remote vs Apple remote
* we bought a house, and they bought the nest - the thermostat, and it's great because it's built by software people
* Consequency: programming is literacy

## Literacy

* people take literacy for granted
* literacy: 1440(printing press, 40% literate) - 2013(now, 99%?)
* if you believe programming, you should pause and thing about where it's going
* fact: young people are not embracing programming - this is a problem
* stem enrollment is stagnating: enrollment in computer science is not groing
* consequence: we have a moral imprative to fix this - it's on us! 
* this problem is in the same ball park as women sufferage, because being literate translate to quality of life
* raganwald - blog post: calling all hackers
* bret victor - inventing on principle (video online) (it is morally wrong to built tools in such a way that ideas are allowed to die) ***highly recommended***
* people try to program and then they quit and part of the reason is the state of the tooling today sucks and doesn't give immediate feedback and then they give up and their ideas die

## Better API can help

* what is an api?
* DOM api vs jQuery API - it's no supprise that John Resig is working on education
* Roy Fielding: REST Web APIs vs SOAP
* SOAP wasn't accessible, REST was
* Twilio API: sending an SMS: example of some node code to send an SMS message. It's just 2 lines of code

## How you can help

  1. make more of the world addressable to programming.
  2. inprove the accessiblity of your apis
  3. commit yourself to helping more people learn how to code
